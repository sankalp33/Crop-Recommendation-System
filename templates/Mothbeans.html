<div  class="para text-justify">

<p><strong>Botanical Name</strong> &nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vigna acontifolia</p>

<p><strong>Origin</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; India</p>

<p><strong>Introduction </strong></p>

<p>Mothbean (Vigna acontifolia) is a native crop of hot and dry habitats of northern and western parts of India. These very adjusting abilities have rendered this crop as an indispensable component of cropping system prevailing in arid regions. This crop is used as a source of food, feed, fodder, green manuring and green pasture. Green pods are delicious source of vegetables. Being a pulse, it is a cheap source of vegetable protein for balancing nutritional deficiency.</p>

<p><strong>Climate </strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It can tolerate high temperature without any adverse effect on flowering and fruit development. Optimum temperature requirement for growth and development is 25-37&ordm;c. Bulk of the cultivation is, confined to dry-lands of arid zone with 250-500 mm rainfall requirement with arrangement of proper drainage.</p>

<p><strong>Field Preparation </strong></p>

<p>In a good rainfall year, one ploughing with mouldboard plough and a cross harrowing serve the purpose in arid conditions of western Rajasthan. Other alternative is Sweep Cultivation with a ferti seed drill (developed at CAZRI) that can also be used for inter cultivation in wide spaced crop.</p>

<p><strong>Sowing Time </strong></p>

<p>With the onset of monsoon, generally start with first soaking rain to second rain after onset of monsoon. Optimum sowing time 2nd to 3rd week of July. Delay in sowing may result in poor growth, poor germination, increased seedling mortality and incidence of pest and diseases and more conspicuously moisture stress at the flowering, the most critical stage.</p>

<p><strong>Seed Rate &amp; Spacing </strong></p>

<p>10-15 kg/ha (short statured, spreading to erect RMO-40 type) for grain and 4-5 kg for mixed crop. For fodder purpose 20-25 kg/ha seed required. Spacing should be maintained as 30-45 cm x 10-20 cm.</p>

<p><strong>Seed Treatment </strong></p>

<p>Seed treatment&nbsp; with 2 g thiram + 1 g Carbendazim / kg of seed. After fungicide treatment seed inocultion with Rhizobium and&nbsp; PSB culture @ 5-7 g /kg of seed.</p>

<p><strong>Irrigation </strong></p>

<p>It is cultivated in dry land and rainfed condition but in long dry spell one irrigation should be given at pod formation stage.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Cropping system </strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Generally grown as single (mono) crop in a year mixed or as a sole crop. However, in a year of good rainfall, it can be rotated with mustard.</li>
	<li>Mixed cropping with pearl millet, cluster bean, cowpea, mung &amp; sesame in risk prone areas during monsoon. Varieties recommended are RMO 40 &amp; FMM 96 of mothbean and HHB 67 of Bajra.</li>
	<li>Inter cropping (2:1) - 2/3 rows of mothbean in between two rows of pearl millet.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Plant nutrient management </strong></p>

<p>Besides their N-fixing capacity they have greater power for absorbing less soluble form of &#39;P&#39;. Recommendation is 20-25 tonnes FYM for improving physical condition and improving water holding capacity of soil along with 10 kg N + 40 kg P2O5/ha as basal at the time of sowing or last preparation.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Weed management </strong></p>

<p>Application of Pendimethalin 30 % EC @ 0.75 -1 kg a.i. / ha as pre-emergence and one hand weeding at 25-30 days after sowing.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Harvesting, threshing &amp; Storage </strong></p>

<p>Crop is ready to harvest when pods get mature and turn brown. Plant shows drying symptom or yellowing of leaves. Estimated Post harvest losses are 9-10% during threshing transportation, processing and storage. Sun drying, heat treatment, and storage at low temperature with low moisture percentage in seeds (8-9%), is recommended.</p>
