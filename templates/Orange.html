<h5 class="headercolor"><b>Introduction</b></h5>
<div  class="para text-justify">

<p>Mandarin orange (Citrus reticulata) is most common among citrus fruits grown in India. It occupies nearly 40% of the total area under citrus cultivation in India. The most important commercial citrus species in India are the mandarin (Citrus reticulata), sweet orange (Citrus sinensis) and acid lime (Citrus aurantifolia)</p>

<p><strong>Area &amp; Production</strong></p>

<p>India ranks third in the world for production of Oranges. Oranges are mostly grown in the states of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Assam, Orissa, West Bengal, Rajasthan, Nagaland, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh</p>

<p><strong>Economic Importance</strong></p>

<p>Orange is rich in vitamin C, A, B and phosphorus. Orange is consumed fresh or in the form of juice, jam, squash and syrup. It is the main source of peel oil, citric acid and cosmetics which have international market value.</p>

<p><strong>Agro-climatic requirements</strong></p>

<p>Mandarins grow successfully in all frost free tropical and sub-tropical regions upto 1,500 m. above m.s.l. An annual rainfall of 100-120 cm. and temperature ranging from 10-35 C is suitable for cultivation of the crop.</p>

<p>Mandarins can be grown in a wide variety of soils but medium or light loamy soils with slightly heavy sub-soil, well-drained with pH of 6.0-8.0 are ideal for cultivation.</p>

<p><strong>Varieties Cultivated</strong></p>

<p>Important mandarin orange varieties cultivated in India are Nagpur Santra, Coorg Santra, Khasi Santra, Mudkhed, Shringar, Butwal, Dancy, Kara (Abohar), SZ-IN-COM, Darjeeling Mandarin, Sumithra mandarin, Seedless-182 and Kinnow mandarin.</p>

<p><strong>Land Preparation</strong></p>

<p>Land is prepared by ploughing, levelling and removing weeds.</p>

<p><strong>Planting Material</strong></p>

<p>Mandarin orange is propagated by seeds and also vegetatively propagated by T-budding.</p>

<p><strong>Planting season</strong></p>

<p>Seedlings are mostly transplanted in the month of July-August after commencement of monsoon. Budding should preferably be done in last week of January or first week of February following the &lsquo;T&rsquo; or shield budding method.</p>

<p><strong>Spacing</strong></p>

<p>Mandarins are usually planted in pits of 50 cm. X 50 cm. X 50 cm. size in a square system with a spacing of 4.5-6 m. , accommodating 350-450 plants/ha. In north-eastern parts of India, Khasi mandarins are very closely spaced (4.5 m. X 4.5 m.), accommodating more than 500 plants/ha. However, a spacing of 6 m. x 6 m. accommodating 120 plants/acre has been considered for the present model.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp; Nutrition</strong></p>

<p>The recommended fertilizer dose interms of N, P &amp; K is given in the following table :</p>

<p>About one third of the recommended dose of nitrogen should be applied through organic manures like FYM, cakes etc. In case of non-bearing trees, nitrogen should be applied in split doses during April, August and November; phosphorus in August and November and potassium in November. Nitrogen should be applied in three split doses in case of bearing trees during April, August and November along with 200 g. phosphorus in two split doses in August and November and 100 g. potassium in November for mandarin grown in black clay soil.</p>

<p><strong>Micronutrients</strong></p>

<p>Micro-nutrients viz. zinc, copper, manganese, iron, boron and molybdenum are required in ample quantities. Improper supply of nutrients may cause serious disorders which may lead to decline of the whole orchard. The micro-nutrients should be supplied through foliar spraying.</p>

<p><strong>Irrigation</strong></p>

<p>Irrigation is provided at an interval of 10-15 days during winter months whereas during summer months it is provided at an interval of 5-7 days.</p>

<p><strong>Intercultural Operations</strong></p>

<p>Pre-emergence herbicides (Diuron @ 3 kg./ha. or Simazine @ 4 kg./ha.) should be sprayed twice at an interval of 120 days from the last week of May for effective and economical control of dicot and monocot weeds in the orchard.</p>

<p><strong>Harvesting and Yield</strong></p>

<p>Fruits are harvested when they attain full size, develop attractive colour with optimum sugar and acid blend. Fruits should be harvested preferably with clipper, shears or secateurs. Mandarins should not be harvested in wet weather or during rains.</p>

<p>Mandarins start bearing from the fourth year but substantial yield can be expected only from sixth year onwards.&nbsp; Mandarin produces 500-800 fruits after about 9-10 years. However, its plants attain the level of full bearing at the age of 10-12 years.&nbsp; The net productive life span of mandarin orchards after deducting the first 5 pre bearing years is only 15-20 years.</p>

<p><strong>Storage</strong></p>

<p>Green or fully ripe fruits can be stored in evaporative cool chamber at 8-10 C &amp; 90-95% relative humidity for a period of three weeks after post-harvest treatment with Bavistin (1000 ppm.).&nbsp; Yellowish green fruits develop attractive yellowish orange in this chamber.</p>

<p><strong>Packing</strong></p>

<p>The harvested fruits are usually washed with chlorine (1000 ppm.) and after removing the surface water they are coated with stayfresh high shine wax (2.5%) containing Bavistin (4000 ppm.) and finally dried at 500-550C in the tunnel dryer.</p>

<p>Fruits are usually packed in wooden boxes for distant markets, while for local marketing baskets of split bamboo and mulberry are used. Chopped straw and dry grass are mostly used for padding. The fruits should be cleaned and polished lightly with a piece of cloth, before wrapping them in tissue paper or newspaper. Use of ventilated corrugated fibre board cartons in place of wooden boxes is highly beneficial.</p>
