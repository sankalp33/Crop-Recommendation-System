<h5 class="headercolor"><b>Introduction</b></h5>
<div  class="para text-justify">

<p>Pomegranate (Punica granatum) is one of the commercially important fruit crops of India. It is native to Iran (Persia).</p>

<p><strong>Area &amp; Production</strong></p>

<p>At the global level, India is the world&rsquo;s largest producer of pomegranates, followed by Iran. Pomegranate is cultivated commercially only in Maharashtra. Small scale plantations are also seen in Gujarat, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana.</p>

<p><strong>Economic Importance</strong></p>

<p>Fruit is consumed fresh or in the form of juice, jam, squash and syrup. Among all forms, canned slices and juice are in much demand in India, constituting about 70% of the production.</p>

<p><strong>Agro-climatic requirements</strong></p>

<p>Pomegranate grows well under semi-arid conditions and can be grown upto an altitude of 500 m. above m.s.l.. It thrives well under hot, dry summer and cold winter provided irrigation facilities are available. The tree requires hot and dry climate during fruit development and ripening.</p>

<p>Pomegranate tree is deciduous in areas of low winter temperature and an evergreen or partially deciduous in tropical and sub-tropical conditions. It can tolerate frost to a considerable extent in dormant stage, but is injured at temperature below - 110 C. Well drained, sandy loan to deep loamy or alluvial soils is suitable for cultivation.</p>

<p><strong>Land Preparation</strong></p>

<p>Land is prepared by ploughing, harrowing, leveling and removing weeds.</p>

<p><strong>Planting Material</strong></p>

<p>Pomegranate is propagated vegetatively by cuttings, air layering or gootee</p>

<p><strong>Planting season</strong></p>

<p>Air layering is usually done during the rainy season and also in November-December.&nbsp; Planting is usually done in spring (February-March) and July-August in sub-tropical and tropical regions respectively.</p>

<p><strong>Spacing</strong></p>

<p>High density planting is adopted in temperate regions. A spacing of 5-6 m. in northern India and also in the plains of Deccan plateau is usually followed.&nbsp; High density planting with a spacing gives 2-2.5 times more yield than that obtained when the normal planting distance of 5 X 5 m. is adopted. Farmers have adopted a spacing of 2.5 X 4.5 m. Closer spacing increases disease and pest incidence.</p>

<p><strong>Planting Method</strong></p>

<p>Square system of planting is mostly adopted. Planting distance is decided on the basis of soil type and climate. A spacing of 4-5 m. on marginal and very light soils is recommended. Pits of 60 X 60 X 60 cm. size are dug (at a spacing of 5 cm. in square system) about a month prior to planting and kept open under the sun for a fortnight. About 50 g. of 5% BHC or carbaryl dust is dusted on the bottom and sides of the pits as a pre-caution against termites.</p>

<p>The pits are filled with top soil mixed with 20 kg. farmyard manure and 1 kg. super phosphate. After filling the pit, watering is done to allow soil to settle down. Cuttings/air layers are then planted and staked. Irrigation is provided immediately after planting.</p>

<p><strong>Nutrition</strong></p>

<p>The recommended fertilizer dose is 600-700 g. N, 200-250 g. P2O5 and 200-250 g. K2O /tree/year. Application of 10 kg. farmyard manure and 75 g. ammonium sulphate to 5 year old tree annually is adequate , whereas application of 50 kg. farmyard manure and 3.5 kg. oil cake or 1 kg. sulphate of ammonia prior to flowering is ideal for healthy growth and fruiting.&nbsp; The time of application is December/January for ambe bahar, May/June for Mrig bahar and October/November for hasthe bahar.</p>

<p>The basal dose of farmyard manure @ 25-40 cart-loads /ha. besides the recommended doses of N, P and K should be applied to non-bearing trees in 3 split doses coinciding with growth of flushes during January, June and September. Fruiting should be encouraged from fourth year onwards. Nitrogenous fertilizer is applied in two split doses starting at the time of first irrigation after bahar treatment and next at 3 weeks interval, whereas full dose of P and K should be applied at one time. These should be applied in a shallow circular trench below tree canopy not beyond a depth of 8-10 cm. After application, fertilizers are covered with top soil and irrigated.</p>

<p><strong>Irrigation</strong></p>

<p>First irrigation is provided in case of mrig bahar crop in the middle of May followed by regular irrigation till the monsoon sets in. Weekly irrigation in summers and that during winters at fortnightly intervals is recommended. The check basin system of irrigation is usually followed.</p>

<p><strong>Inter-cropping</strong></p>

<p>Inter-cropping with low growing vegetables, pulses or green manure crops is beneficial. In arid regions, inter-cropping is possible only during the rainy season, whereas winter vegetables are feasible in irrigated areas.</p>

<p><strong>Diseases</strong></p>

<p>The main diseases reported are leaf spot and fruit rot. Application of Mancozeb (2g./l.) during rainy season in case of the former and application of Kavach (2g./l) and Carbendazim/Thiophanate methyl/Baycor/Benomyl (1g./l.) during September/October in case of the latter has been found to be effective in most cases.</p>

<p><strong>Harvesting&nbsp; and Yield</strong></p>

<p>Pomegranate being a non-climacteric fruit should be picked when fully ripe. Pomegranate plants take 4-5 years to come into bearing.&nbsp; Harvesting of immature or over mature fruits affects the quality of the fruits. The fruits become ready for picking 120-130 days after fruit set. The calyx at the distal end of the fruit gets closed on maturity. At maturity, the fruits turn yellowish-red and get suppressed on sides.</p>

<p><strong>Storage</strong></p>

<p>Fruits can be stored in cold storage upto 2 months or 10 weeks at a temperature of 5 C. Longer storage should be at 10 C and 95% RH to avoid chilling injury and weight loss.</p>
