<h5 class="headercolor"><b>Introduction</b></h5>
<div  class="para text-justify">

<p>A grape is a fruit, botanically a berry, of the deciduous woody vines of the flowering plant genus Vitis. Grapes can be eaten fresh as table grapes or they can be used for making wine, jam, grape juice, jelly, grape seed extract, raisins, vinegar, and grape seed oil. Grapes are a non-climacteric type of fruit, generally occurring in clusters. &nbsp;It is a temperate crop which has got adapted to sub-tropical climate of peninsular India.</p>

<p><strong>Production</strong></p>

<p>India ranks seventh in the world in the production of grape. About 80% of the production comes from Maharashtra followed by Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.</p>

<p><strong>Agro-climatic Requirements</strong></p>

<p>Grape is a versatile crop that can adjust to any type of climate. In Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, China, Pakistan, Israel and North India it is grown under sub-tropical conditions. It is also cultivated under the tropical climatic conditions of Chile, Argentina, Venezuela, Kenya, South and West India.</p>

<p>Sandy to clayey and loamy soil with good drainage and irrigation facilities is suitable for the cultivation of Grapes. Soils having pH value from 6.5 to 7.5 are most suitable. In its natural habitat, the crop bears fruit during the hot and dry period and undergoes dormancy during the period of severe cold.</p>

<p>&nbsp;It tolerates frost during resting stage but is very susceptible during growing period. Temperature ranging from 15-350 C is ideal for shoot growth and normal physiological processes of the grapevine. Vines do not grow and fruit well when the temperature falls below 100 C.</p>

<p>Locations where the annual rainfall does not exceed 900 mm. are ideal for its cultivation.&nbsp; More than the amount of rainfall received during a year, the number of rainy days in a year and the occurrence of rains in relation to the stage of growth of the vine is important.&nbsp; Humidity associated with rains during flowering and fruit ripening is not favourable and invites the attack of fungal diseases.</p>

<p><strong>Land Preparation</strong></p>

<p>Land is leveled by a tractor or bulldozer as per the requirement, soil type and gradient.&nbsp; In case of drip irrigation, leveling need not be perfect. The size of the plot will vary with the type of training system used. In case of bower and telephone or &ldquo;T&rdquo; trellis the ideal size could be 60 X 80 m. and 90 X 120 m. respectively.</p>

<p><strong>Planting</strong></p>

<p>Grape is usually propagated by hard wood cuttings, though propagation by seed, soft wood cuttings, layering, grafting and budding is also used in some cases.The grapevines are usually planted in pits. The size of the pit depends upon the spacing of the vines and also on the specific requirements of the variety. The depth may vary from 60 to 90 cm. depending upon the soil type.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wider spacing (1.2 m. X 1.2 m.) is required in case of vigorous varieties like Anab-e-Shahi and Bangalore Blue. A little less than that (i.e. 90 X 90 cm.) is required in case of varieties viz. Thompson Seedless, Perlette and Beauty Seedless. In central Maharashtra and northern parts of Karnataka the spacing adopted for Thompson seedless and its mutants is 1.8m X 2.4 m. The pits need to be opened about a month before planting.</p>

<p>Planting is usually avoided during the rainy season. The best time for planting is February-March in North India, November-January in the peninsular India. In Karnataka and Tamil Nadu it is usually planted during December-January, due to the fact that rainy season lasts upto end of November.</p>

<p>Growth of the plants starts 10-15 days after planting, depending upon the season of planting. Growth occurs earlier in case of those planted during warm season as compared to those planted in cold season.&nbsp; After one month of planting, the young plants need staking and training.</p>

<p><strong>Irrigation</strong></p>

<p>Irrigation practices vary considerably in different regions of India depending upon the rainfall pattern, time of pruning, different growth stages, water-holding capacity of soil, variety grown, training system followed and spacing of vines. Irrigation is provided once in every three days in newly planted vineyards by allowing water into a small circular basin of 50 cm. radius. With the increase in growth rate the size of the basin increases to a radius of 2m. In case of drip irrigation, only one emitter is placed at the base of the vine.</p>

<p>The number of emitters gradually increases to two and then four which are shifted about 30 or 40cm. away from the stem depending upon the variety and spacing of the vines. Heavy irrigation is provided soon after pruning in order to wet the entire root zone thoroughly and induce active growth in the vine. Light irrigation of 50-75mm. (5.0-7.5 L./ha.) is given is given at an interval of 10-12 days during winter and 5-7 days in summers. In the event of rainfall during that interval, the next irrigation is either omitted or delayed. Irrigation frequency is reduced during anthesis, fruiting stage and also after berry softening to improve fruit quality.</p>

<p><strong>Harvesting and Yield</strong></p>

<p>In North India, plants start fruiting after two years of planting.&nbsp; Berries start ripening from the end of May in early varieties. However, most of the varieties are harvested after they have changed colour near the tip and have become sweet. A day prior to picking, the broken, decayed, deformed, under-sized berries are removed. The clusters are usually harvested during the early hours of the day before the temperature rises above 20<sup>‚Å∞</sup> C.</p>

<p><strong>Pre-Cooling</strong></p>

<p>Pre-cooling is done to reduce the field heat, moisture loss and subsequently increase the storability of grapes.&nbsp; Fruit needs to be pre-cooled to a temperature below 4.40 C within six hours after harvesting in cold rooms, forced air coolers, refrigerator cars and tunnels. Cooling of grapes is generally carried out in special rooms attached to the cold storage units.&nbsp; Mobile pre-cooling units (refrigerator cars) are also in operation to cool the grapes during their transport to the cold storage units situated away from the production site.</p>

<p><strong>Storage</strong></p>

<p>The shelf life of grapes is only one week at room temperature. The storage life of grapes can be increased by employing suitable means to reduce desiccation, decay due to growth of fungi</p>
